    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>I love this recipe it's so good. Yum yum yum!</p>

    <p>A recipe passed down for generations.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Pie dough for top and bottom 9-inch pie, chilled. See <a href="https://www.inspiredtaste.net/22662/flaky-pie-crust-recipe/">Flaky Pie Crust Recipe</a></li>
        <li>4 to 4 1/4 pounds baking apples (7 to 8 apples)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (100 grams) light or dark brown sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (100 grams) granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground allspice</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons cornstarch or use 4 tablespoons tapioca flour/starch</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <h4>Make Apple Filling:</h4>

    <ol>
        <li>Peel, and then cut the apples in half. Remove the cores, and then slice apple halves into thin slices, about 1/4-inch thick. Place the apple slices into a very large bowl.</li>
        <li>Scatter both sugars, salt, and spices over the apples, and then use your hands to toss them, coating the apple slices as much as possible. Set aside for 1 hour at room temperature.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Prepare Pie Crust:</h4>

    <ol>
        <li>Roll out the first half of pie dough on a lightly floured work surface. To prevent the dough from sticking and to ensure uniform thickness, roll from the center of the dough outwards and keep lifting up and turning the dough a quarter turn as you roll. Check for the correct size by inverting the pie dish over the dough. The dough should be about 1 1/2 to 2 inches larger than the dish.</li>
        <li>Being careful not to stretch it, place the dough into the pie dish, and then trim overhanging dough to within 3/4-inch of the edge of the dish. Refrigerate while you make the pie filling.</li>
        <li>Roll out the second half of the dough to a similar size as before and transfer it to a large parchment-lined baking sheet. Keep this in the refrigerator until needed.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Prepare Oven:</h4>

    <ol>
        <li>Position an oven rack towards the center of the oven, and then heat the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit (200C).</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Assemble Pie:</h4>

    <ol>
        <li>Toss cornstarch (or tapioca) with the apples. Transfer most (if not all) of the apples into the prepared bottom crust, using your hands to really pack them down into the pie. Fill the pie until apples are mounded at the same height as the edge of the pie crust. If you have too many apples, save them (see notes).</li>
        <li>Pour the juices that have accumulated at the bottom of the bowl over the apples. (If it looks like there’s more than 3/4 to 1 cup of liquid, you might want to leave some behind, see notes below). Cut a tablespoon of butter into 8 or so small pieces and dot them over the pie.</li>
        <li>For a double-crust pie, place the second pie dough round over the filling or cut it into strips and lattice the top (Read <a href="https://www.inspiredtaste.net/23250/how-to-make-a-lattice-pie-crust/">this tutorial for how to lattice pie crust</a>). If you are not adding a lattice crust and instead are adding the top crust in one piece, use a sharp knife to cut a few slits in the top of the crust to allow steam to vent.</li>
        <li>Trim excess dough from the top crust or lattice strips, and then fold the overhang underneath itself, forming a thick rim. Press it together or crimp it with your fingers (or use a fork).</li>
        <li>Whisk the egg with a tablespoon of water, and then use it as an egg wash by lightly brushing the top crust. This adds shine and helps the crust brown.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Bake Pie:</h4>

    <ol>
        <li>Place the prepared pie onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper (this can be the same lined baking sheet used for chilling the top crust). Bake the pie for about 75 minutes, turning a few times for even browning.</li>
        <li>If you notice that the pie crust is browning too quickly, mold a large piece of foil over a bowl that’s been placed upside down to make a foil dome. Place the foil dome over the pie for the remaining bake time. This will slow the browning.</li>
        <li>Apple pie is done when the juices are bubbling through the vents of the top crust or lattice. If you do not see bubbles, the pie needs more time. Another way to check for doneness is to use an internal thermometer. Pierce the pie in the middle then test the temperature. The pie is done when it reads 195 degrees Fahrenheit (90C). Piercing the pie is also a nice indication of how soft the apples are. If they feel too crunchy, the pie needs more time.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Serving:</h4>

    <ol>
        <li>Be sure to cool the pie, without slicing into it, for at least 1 hour, preferably longer. Keep in mind that the pie filling does not fully thicken until it is completely cooled. So, for the absolute best results, cool the pie to room temperature, and then place it into the refrigerator for an hour or two.</li>
        <li>Waiting to cut into the pie until cool will prevent a soggy slice.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Storing and Leftovers:</h4>

    <ol>
        <li>Leftover pie will keep, at room temperature, for 2 to 3 days or in the refrigerator up to a week. Rewarm slices in a 350 degree Fahrenheit oven for 5 to 10 minutes before serving them.</li>
    </ol>
